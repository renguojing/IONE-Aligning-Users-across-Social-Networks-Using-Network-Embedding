# IONE-Aligning-Users-across-Social-Networks-Using-Network-Embedding.
Aligning Users across Social Networks Using Network Embedding(IJCAI)，paper author uses Java(https://github.com/ColaLL/IONE),For wider application, we have updated the python version，use tensorflow1.14.0

Source Code and anonymous twitter_foursquare data for IJCAI 2016 paper "Aligning Users Across Social Networks Using Network Embedding"
Feel free to contact athuor (Liu Li liuli0407@hotmail.com) when you have any problems about the paper or the code(Java 8).



Feel free to contact me (Zihan Yan yzhcqupt@163.com) when you have any problems about the code(Python tensorflow1.14.0)




#For the IONE, run the __main__.py.

#You should first run the __main__.py and second run the IONE_T.py to get the Twitter and Foursquare's embedding
